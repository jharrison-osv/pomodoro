# Pomodoro

This is a Pomodoro application, made with Electron, Angular and ❤︎.
It's really simple to use.
If you want to develop, just see the README in the develop branch. 

### Why another pomodoro?

There is no pomodoro app that I liked for Windows. So, I started my own.
Also, I do this to learn, and develop better developer skills.
